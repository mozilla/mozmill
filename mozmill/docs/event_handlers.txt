# Pluggable Events

Mozmill is an event dispatcher system, using jsbridge to communicate
events triggered in JavaScript to the python harness.
Mozmill is run like:

 mozmill -app firefox -t path/to/test.js [options]

This will do the following:

 - the application, in this case `firefox`, will be looked for (see:
   mozrunner)

 - a profile object will be created of the approriate type (see:
   mozprofile)

 - a python-javascript bridge will be created (see: jsbridge)

 - the `test.js` file will be sent over the jsbridge where it is
   loaded and executed (see: resource://mozmill/modules/frame.js )

 - events will be sent from JavaScript back to python where they will
   be listened for (see: resource://mozmill/modules/frame.js )  

Note that except a few conventions, mozmill is more driver code and
event handling than a testing framework.


## Events

Events send the signature `(eventType, obj)`.  `eventType` is
the string name of the event (e.g. `mozmill.endTest`) and ``obj` is
an object sent with the event.  A python callable signature for a given event
takes `obj` as an argument, e.g:

    self.add_listener(self.persist_listener, eventType="mozmill.persist")
    def persist_listener(self, obj):
        self.persisted = obj


## Pluggable Event Listeners

Mozmill allows python modules to plug into the event listener system.
This is done by denoting them as a setuptools entry point with the key
`mozmill.event_handlers` (see mozmill's setup.py for examples).

(*TODO: document support for allowing handlers to live in free-standing
files*)

Three event handlers are included with Mozmill by default via
the setuptools entry point `mozmill.event_handlers`:

- [Logging](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill/blob/master/mozmill/mozmill/logger.py)
- [Report](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill/blob/master/mozmill/mozmill/report.py)
- [PythonCallbacks](https://github.com/mozautomation/mozmill/blob/master/mozmill/mozmill/python_callbacks.py)

When running from the command line, these are on by default.  However,
you may use the `--disable` command line argument to turn them off:

    mozmill -t foo.js --disable Logging --report stdout 

This command line will dump the JSON of the report to stdout.

You can see how these are instantiated in mozmill's setup.py in the
`entry_points` section.


## Command Line Invocation Infrastructure

Event handlers may add events via an `add_options` class method to
which the parser is passed (see: `mozmill.CLI.add_options`).
When driving via the command line, the handlers are instantiated with
the passed-in options.  `mozmill.handlers.instantiate_handler`
introspects the passed in handler to determine which command line
options are needed and constructs the object based on this
information (it is a handler-factory).  If the handler raises a
`mozmill.handlers.HandlerMatchException` the handler is not
instantiated or passed to the MozMill constructor.

As an example, see the constructor of `mozmill.report.Report`.  If
`report` is `None`, as it would be if not specified via the command
line (see the class's `add_options` method for `--report`), then
the class is not instantiated or utilized.


## API Usage

One of the primary motiviations for the restructuring of the command
line handling as well as adding pluggable events is to make writing
APIs around Mozmill easier.  Previously, it was difficult (a
significant chunk of code needed to be replicated, which of course
relies on innards not changing to be maintainable) to invoke MozMill
programmatically at all and impossible to extend it in many ways.


## Structure of an Event Handler

The basic methods for an event handler is given in
`mozmill.handlers.EventHandler`.  While this class is never
inherited from, it shows the basic methods that event handlers can
have.  

The `add_options` method is used to add options to the command line
parser.

In order to be utilized from the command line, the handler should have
a constructor.  A blank one is fine.  The attribute names for the
constructor signature should match those in `add_options` if you
wished them to be controllable from the command line.

If an event handler is callable, then all events and their event types
will be passed to the `__call__` method.  It is a global event handler

The event handler should have an `events` method.  This should
return a dict of names of events to listen for mapped to the methods
that listen to these events.

Ccurrently the event type is a string by convention only.  We
have no catalog of events to be listened for.  A list of applicable
events should be maintained as well as when each is called by the
tests.  It would be even better if this was programmatic.

If the event handler has a `stop()` method, this is called at the
end of the test run internally to python (no JS communication is done
here).  Whether the stop is fatal or not (something bad has happened,
e.g. an exception) is passed in.  This gives event handlers the
opportunity to output final statistics and otherwise do cleanup.
